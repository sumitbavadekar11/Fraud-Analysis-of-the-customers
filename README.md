# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Analysis

In this repo, I have done a project on machine learning classification problem statement, which requires a huge dataset that I got from third-party websites. Don't worry, I want to share the dataset with you, and you can get it from here:

Developed a machine learning project for spam and ham email classification. Loaded the dataset using Pandas, performed data preprocessing, handled missing values, and conducted exploratory data analysis. Applied transformation techniques, selected the best features, and developed models using GRU, LSTM, RNN, and bi-directional LSTM algorithms. Evaluated the models using validation techniques and selected the best model based on AUC and ROC analysis. Applied hyperparameter tuning, saved and validated the model. Integrated the model with Flask, generated outcomes, and deployed the project as an API.
