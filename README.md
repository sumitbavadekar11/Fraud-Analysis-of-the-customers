# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Analysis

In this repo, I have done a project on machine learning classification problem statement. Amd  developed machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, considering various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines

Collected a dataset of credit card transactions from various sources to analyze and detect fraudulent activities.
Loaded the dataset using Pandas library and performed initial data checks to understand its structure and characteristics.
Split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that all training operations were performed on the test data to prevent data leakage.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data, including checking for normal distribution, identifying outliers, and handling missing values.
Applied transformation techniques to preprocess both numerical and categorical data, ensuring data compatibility for modeling.
Selected the best features from the dataset using appropriate feature selection techniques for both numerical and categorical data.
Developed machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, considering various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.
Validated the models using appropriate validation techniques, assessing their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluated the models based on AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis to select the best-performing model.
Performed hyperparameter tuning on the top-performing model to optimize its performance further.
Saved the final model for future use, ensuring reproducibility and efficiency.
Integrated the model with a Flask web application, leveraging HTML and CSS to create an interactive user interface.
Deployed the application on a server, making the credit card fraud analysis accessible via a web-based interface.
Generated an API to provide seamless integration of the project's functionalities into other systems.
Shared the project API with relevant stakeholders, enabling them to leverage the fraud detection capabilities in their own applications
